# AutomataWithSimpleGui

This simple project has been made to help people to check if a word is related to a language, 
this project works only with gramma that has exactly two alphabets like(0,1) or (a,b),
so it is going to be useful for people working with binary system.

How this programme works:
Step 1: define your gramma
Step 2: define the first state
Step 3: define the final states
Step 4: input you the word to wish to check and you will see the output
done.

I hope it will help.
